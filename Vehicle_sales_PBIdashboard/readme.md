# USA Used Vehicle Sales Analysis (January - June 2015)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes used vehicle sales data in the USA, focusing on the first half of 2015. Utilizing Python and Pandas, the project cleans and organizes data from `car_prices.csv` into four dataframes: `fact_sales`, `Seller_IDs`, `Vehicle_conditions`, and `VIN_details`, which are then saved as CSV files. These files serve as the foundation for a comprehensive 3-page report created in Power BI, detailing sales by vehicle attributes and sellers.

### Objectives
- To clean and organize used vehicle sales data.
- To analyze sales trends by vehicle make, model, body type, color, and seller.
- To identify key sales patterns and insights within the selected time period.

## Data Source

The primary data source for this analysis is the `car_prices.csv` file, which contains detailed records of used vehicle sales across the USA.

## Dataframes and Analysis

The project generates the following dataframes:
- `fact_sales`: Aggregated sales data.
- `Seller_IDs`: Unique identifiers for sellers.
- `Vehicle_conditions`: Condition ratings of the vehicles.
- `VIN_details`: Detailed information extracted from the vehicle identification numbers (VIN).

These dataframes are exported as CSV files and analyzed to uncover insights on sales trends, popular vehicle models, and performance of different vehicle makes.

## Key Findings

- 43% of sales were generated by vehicles priced between $10K and $20K.
- Total sales amounted to $6.98 billion, with 504,000 vehicles sold.
- February 2015 saw the highest sales, with $2.22 billion.
- Ford was the most popular make, contributing to 18.2% of the total sales value.
- The average price of the sold vehicles was $14,000, with an average mileage of 67,000 miles and an average age of 4.73 years.
- Ford led sales in four price segments, while Chevrolet was most popular for vehicles under $5,000. BMW dominated the luxury segment, with vehicles priced over $40,000.
- The top five makes by sales value were Ford, Chevrolet, Nissan, Toyota, and Dodge, collectively contributing to about 40% of total sales.

## Setup and Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Power BI Desktop

### Instructions
1. **Data Preparation**: Use Python and Pandas to clean and organize the dataset. The script `data_preparation.py` demonstrates how to transform `car_prices.csv` into structured dataframes.

2. **Data Analysis and Report Creation**: Import the generated CSV files into Power BI. Use the guide `power_bi_analysis.md` to create visualizations and compile the 3-page report.

3. **Viewing the Report**: Open the report in Power BI Desktop to explore the insights and data visualizations.
