# AdventureWorks Cycles Business Intelligence Project

## Overview

AdventureWorks Cycles is a leading manufacturing company focused on delivering high-quality bicycles and related accessories. 
This project involves the role of a Business Intelligence Analyst aimed at transforming raw data into insightful, professional-quality reports and dashboards. 
These tools will track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

This project's goal is to simulate real-world tasks that data professionals encounter, enhancing decision-making and strategic planning capabilities through data-driven insights.

## Project Stages

### Stage 1: Connecting & Shaping Data

The initial stage focuses on establishing automated workflows for extracting, transforming, and loading data using Power Query. Key tasks include:

- **Data Extraction**: Utilize various data connectors to access data from databases and web sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Employ Power Query tools for table transformations, indexing, conditional columns, and more.
- **Data Profiling and QA**: Implement profiling tools to ensure data quality and accuracy.

### Stage 2: Creating a Relational Data Model

Building a robust data model is crucial for effective analysis. This stage covers:

- **Normalization and Schemas**: Implement database normalization and organize data into star and snowflake schemas.
- **Key Relationships**: Define and manage primary and foreign keys, and understand relationship cardinality.
- **Filtering and Contexts**: Set up bi-directional filters and manage filter context within the data model.

### Stage 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX

To enhance the data model, calculated columns and measures will be created using DAX, focusing on:

- **DAX**:  Syntax and operators, along with key functions like CALCULATE, FILTER, and iterator functions.
- **Advanced Measures**: Develop complex measures using time intelligence patterns and conditional logic.

### Stage 4: Visualizing Data with Reports

The final stage brings data to life through interactive reports and dashboards. Key components include:

- **Data Visualization Best Practices**: Creating visually appealing and informative dashboards.
- **Interactive Elements**: Implement slicers, tooltips, and navigation elements to enhance user interaction.
- **Publishing**: Finalize reports and publish them on the Power BI Service for shared business insights.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Microsoft Power BI**: Primary tool for ETL, data modeling, and visualization.
- **Power Query**: For data extraction and transformation.
- **DAX**: For advanced data manipulation within Power BI.
